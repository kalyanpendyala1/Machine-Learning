    "One main difference between logistic regression and linear regression is how the line is fit to the data. With linear regression we fit line using '**least squares method**'. In other words we find the line that minimizes the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSE). We also use residuals to calculate R-square and to compare simpler models with complicated models.\n",
